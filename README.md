# About me

### Hometown
I grew up "in a small town" called Seymour in Indiana. Seymour is famous for a train robbery see (here)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_Gang] and (John Cougar Mellancamp)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mellencamp] but overall is very roural middle America. 
### College
I graduated from Indiana University (Bloomington) with a degree in Computer Science.
### Career
When I graduated I started out working for _Caterpillar_ in Peoria, IL. I worked there for 2 years before moving to Minnetonka to work for Tar-jay (Target). At Target I worked on a relatively high throughput API (over 1k Transactions per second). We refactored the app from distributed to a centralized app all while building within a new micro-services framework. 

### Recreation
Outside of work I love to watch IU basketball and football. In the summer I am usually outside golfing in Chaska or going on weekend camping trips.
