# About me

### Hometown
I grew up "in a small town" called Seymour in Indiana. Seymour is famous for a train robbery see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reno_Gang) and [John Cougar Mellancamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Mellencamp) but overall is rural quite town of about 20,000. 
### College
I graduated from Indiana University (Bloomington) with a degree in Computer Science.
### Career
When I graduated I started out working for _Caterpillar_ in Peoria, IL. I worked there for 2 years before moving to Minnetonka to work for _Target_. At _Target_ I worked on a relatively high throughput API (over 1k Transactions per second). We refactored the app from distributed to a centralized app all while building within a new micro-services framework. 

### Recreation
Outside of work I love to watch IU basketball and football. In the summer I am usually outside golfing in Chaska or going on weekend camping trips. 

Here is a quick list of the top courses in the metro IMHO:
1. [Edinburgh](http://www.edinburghusa.com/)
2. [Chaska](http://www.chaskatowncourse.com/)
3. [The Links at Northfolk](http://www.golfthelinks.com/)

If you dissagree with this list let me know your favorite courses!
